# Problem Statement : 
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable
# Dataset used : Global Food Price Inflation
# Description: 
Food price inflation is an important metric to inform economic policy but traditional sources of consumer prices are often produced with delay during crises and only at an aggregate level. This may poorly reflect the actual price trends in rural or poverty-stricken areas, where large populations reside in fragile situations. This data set includes Global Food Price Estimates and Inflation by Product, Market, and Country. It helps gain insight into price developments beyond what can be formally measured by traditional methods.
